# Cloud Migration and Modernization Project

## Project Overview

**Cloud Computing Project using AWS and Google Cloud**

*Please note: Due to confidentiality, I cannot share the code for this project developed for a local business. However, I have provided a comprehensive explanation of my work and methodologies.*

## Objective

**Migrating legacy applications and databases from on-premise servers to cloud infrastructure using AWS and Google Cloud, to leverage advanced cloud computing solutions for enhanced scalability, performance, and cost-efficiency.**

## Problem Statement

1. **Legacy Infrastructure**: The existing setup was on outdated on-premise servers, leading to high maintenance costs, scalability issues, and limited disaster recovery capabilities.
2. **Performance Bottlenecks**: Applications experienced frequent downtime and slow performance due to hardware limitations and lack of modern resource management.
3. **Scalability Challenges**: The old infrastructure struggled to handle increased load and demand, impacting business operations and user experience.
4. **Data Security Concerns**: Ensuring data integrity and security was complex with the aging infrastructure.

## Solution: Cloud Migration and Modernization

### Key Technologies Used

- **AWS S3 Bucket**: For efficient and secure storage of application data.
- **Google Cloud SQL**: To provide managed, scalable, and reliable relational database services.
- **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**: For container orchestration to manage application deployment, scaling, and operations.
- **Terraform**: For Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to automate the deployment and management of cloud resources.

## Implementation Steps

### Assessment and Planning

- Identified dependencies, performance requirements, and potential migration challenges.
- Developed a detailed migration plan and timeline.

### Infrastructure Setup

1. **AWS S3 Bucket**
   - Created S3 buckets for data storage.
   - Configured bucket policies and permissions for secure data access.
   
2. **Google Cloud SQL**
   - Set up Cloud SQL instances.
   - Configured database settings for optimal performance and security.
   
3. **Google Kubernetes Engine**
   - Created GKE clusters for containerized applications.
   - Configured cluster autoscaling and load balancing.
   
4. **Terraform**
   - Wrote Terraform scripts to automate the provisioning of AWS S3, Google Cloud SQL, and GKE resources.
   - Used Terraform to manage infrastructure changes and maintain consistency across environments.

### Data Migration

- Migrated application data to AWS S3 using efficient data transfer methods.
- Transferred databases to Google Cloud SQL, ensuring minimal downtime and data integrity.
- Verified data consistency and performed thorough testing post-migration.

### Application Deployment

- Containerized applications using Docker.
- Deployed containerized applications to GKE clusters.
- Implemented CI/CD pipelines to automate build, test, and deployment processes.
- Monitored application performance and made necessary adjustments for optimization.

### Optimization and Maintenance

- Set up monitoring and alerting for cloud resources using Google Cloud Monitoring and AWS CloudWatch.
- Implemented cost optimization strategies for efficient resource utilization.
- Conducted regular maintenance and updates to ensure security and performance.

## Outcomes and Benefits

- **Improved Scalability**: Easily scale applications up or down based on demand without hardware constraints.
- **Enhanced Performance**: Reduced downtime and improved application response times.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Lowered infrastructure and maintenance costs by leveraging pay-as-you-go cloud services.
- **Increased Security**: Enhanced data security and compliance with advanced cloud security features.
